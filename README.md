# baxter_arm_control

Follow the instructions at http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/wiki/Workstation_Setup to setup the workspace for baxter
then clone this repository into the source file of baxter workspace
follow the instructions is "operation.py" file to complete the setup process
my actual setup process and all the references I followed are in the "my setup.py" file.

"operation.py" and "my setup.py" are just README files, I made them as python files just because it looks good with all the colors.
